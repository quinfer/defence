abstract = {{We assess the changing nature of the relationships between financial institutions and sovereigns globally using a weighted, directed network of CDS spreads. The framework includes both the strength and direction of the links in the network, allowing us to formally test for evidence on changes in the completeness of the network, for contagion effects, and for strengthening and weakening of the links in the network. We find evidence of all of these effects for 107 US dollar denominated CDS spreads over 2003–2014. We use the results to illustrate the change from a relatively robust network with some vulnerability to financial sector shocks in the pre-GFC period to a highly fragile network during the GFC and a subsequent return to greater robustness post-GFC where, despite the Greek and European debt crisis effects, fragility is similar when sourced from either financial sector or sovereign debt shocks.}},

abstract = {{We provide a simple and intuitive measure of interdependence of asset returns and/or volatilities. In particular, we formulate and examine precise and separate measures of return spillovers and volatility spillovers. Our framework facilitates study of both non‐crisis and crisis episodes, including trends and bursts in spillovers; both turn out to be empirically important. In particular, in an analysis of 19 global equity markets from the early 1990s to the present, we find striking evidence of divergent behaviour in the dynamics of return spillovers vs. volatility spillovers: return spillovers display a gently increasing trend but no bursts, whereas volatility spillovers display no trend but clear bursts.}},

We also show that variance decompositions define weighted, directed networks, so that our connectedness measures are intimately related to key measures of connectedness used in the network literature. Building on these insights, we track daily time-varying connectedness of major US financial institutions’ stock return volatilities in recent years, with emphasis on the financial crisis of 2007–2008.}},

abstract = {{This paper proposes a new measure of contagion as the coincidence of large left-tail events in the idiosyncratic disturbances of international stock returns after controlling for their exposure to a global factor. Episodes of bad contagion, especially those involving a large number of countries, are followed by a significant drop in international stock returns. This predictability pattern can be understood as an international transmission effect, as bad contagion only affects countries that did not experience tail events. In addition, the negative effect of bad contagion spills over to real growth, sovereign default risk, and financial stability indicators.}},

We apply our technique to study credit risk spillovers among a group of 17 sovereigns and their respective financial sectors between January 2006 and December 2017. We show that idiosyncratic credit risk shocks propagate much more strongly in both tails than at the conditional mean or median. Furthermore, we develop a measure of the relative spillover intensity in the right and left tails of the conditional distribution that provides a timely aggregate measure of systemic financial fragility and that can be used for risk management and monitoring purposes. This paper was accepted by Gustavo Manso, finance.}},
